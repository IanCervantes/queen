One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
The bell that rings inside your mind
It's a challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
It's a kind of magic
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be gone
This is a kind of magic
There can only be one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone (gone)
Magic, it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Magic, ha ha ha ha it's magic
Ha ha
Yeah, yeah
It's a kind of magic
